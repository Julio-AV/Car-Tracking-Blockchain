Connection handler:
    - Test one to n script with more nodes
    - Fix auto connection <-- Not needed, but it would be nice fixing it
    - Add timeout for hosts that don't exist  

- Implementing the blockchain <-- Previous step
- Complete data_handler <-- Current step
- Complete simulations 

Blockchain:
    Complete transaction validation
    Complete block validation


Data handler:
    - add transaction list clearing (pending)

Node: 
    - Keep in mind that when a block is broadcasted, transaction_list is flushed (or not, we'll see), but if it is flushed, we need 
        to check on node whether a transaction was on the blockchain or not
Simulations:
    Create key handler
    Create blockchain key management 
    Adapt and test current simulations with blockchain implemented simulation
    Create semi-connected scenario
    Create realistic scenario simulation

Refactoring: 
    - Rename TransactionFactory to BlockchainFactory


Possible errors and debugging:
    Add python output redirecting on docker machines to keep record of traces
    Possible error decoding digital sign after sending through sockets


Que hacer mañana:
    empezar con la simulación
    quizás te tocará cambiar el tema de los imports, porque me parece que no soportan los imports relativos
