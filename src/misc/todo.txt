- Test one to n script with more nodes
- Fix auto connection <-- Not needed, but it would be nice fixing it
- Add timeout for hosts that don't exist  

- Start implementing the blockchain <-- Next step, good luck
- Complete data_handler <-- Along with blockchain


Blockchain:
    Define the transactions --> Serialize them: JSON | str, and verify them
    Define block structure: Transactions list, merkle root of transactions 
    Define header: Calculate merkle root of transactions, and block hash to prepare for broadcasting
