### Scenario
This scenario consists in two machines, one which is completely autonomous (one_on_one_auto) and other managed by you (manager).

This scenario is designed to test basic communications as well as testing basic behaviour of code in the docker machines.

You don't need to create the machines by yourself, the code will do it for you!

**The machines will always execute the main.py file, so remember to put their path, and all their dependencies in the copy funcions.**
