Connection handler:
    - Test one to n script with more nodes
    - Fix auto connection <-- Not needed, but it would be nice fixing it
    - Add timeout for hosts that don't exist  

- Complete simulations 


Data handler:
    - add transaction list clearing (pending)

Node: 
    - Keep in mind that when a block is broadcasted, transaction_list is flushed (or not, we'll see), but if it is flushed, we need 
        to check on node whether a transaction was on the blockchain or not

Simulations: 
    Adapt and test current simulations with blockchain implemented simulation
    Create semi-connected scenario
    Create realistic scenario simulation

Refactoring: 
    - Rename TransactionFactory to BlockchainFactory


Possible errors and debugging:
    Possible error decoding digital sign after sending through sockets
    Only 5 connections are accepted per socket
